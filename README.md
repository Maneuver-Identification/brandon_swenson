This file contains several steps that are covered in depth within the python notebook. The approach first utilizes Plotly to visualize the data in both 2D and 3D.

Then, the data set is created by separating the training data from the testing data. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then built to be trained by the truth data (manually sorted) and eventually be able to classify the testing data.
